# Image-colorization-supervised-and-selfsupervised-ML

### Step 1: Download data
Our data is from Kaggle and you can find them in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theblackmamba31/landscape-image-colorization

After you download the data you should make 2 folders, train, and test. You should put 6900 color photos in the train folder and the rest of color photos in the test.

### Step 2: Training the models
There are trained models saved in the submited project but you can also train them yourself. The models desigend in a way that you can also continue to learn the existing checkpoints even more.
For train the 3 layer model you should run 3layer_model.py, for 5 layer you should run 5layer_model.py, for 7 layer you should run 7layer_model.py, for 13 layer you should run 13layer_model.py, and for resnet model you should run resnet_model.py.
